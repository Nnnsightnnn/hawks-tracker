  summary:
    "Game 1 tips TONIGHT at 6 PM ET at Madison Square Garden on Prime Video — the Hawks' first playoff game since 2023 and Jalen Johnson's postseason debut. Atlanta's Game 1 starting five was confirmed pre-game (SI, Apr 18): CJ McCollum, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Dyson Daniels, Jalen Johnson, Onyeka Okongwu — the +25 net-rating group that has powered the 20-6 post-All-Star surge. Injury report is essentially clean: only Jock Landale (right high-ankle sprain) is ruled out; Johnson, NAW, Okongwu, and Kispert all cleared after sitting the regular-season finale. Knicks are 6.5-point favorites (DraftKings) and won the regular-season series 2-1, both wins by three. The bigger storyline hanging over this run: Quin Snyder's contract — he's in the final year of his deal and HoopsHype reported Apr 12 that Atlanta and Snyder are exploring an extension. Zaccharie Risacher, last year's No. 1 pick, was a healthy scratch on his 21st birthday Wednesday; Corey Kispert has absorbed his rotation minutes. Series is 3-6 in the East: Knicks 53-29, Hawks 46-36.",
